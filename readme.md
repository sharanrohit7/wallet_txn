Wallet Transaction Report Generator
Overview
This project is a wallet transaction report generator that utilizes Prisma for database operations and Express.js for handling HTTP requests. It fetches transaction data from a database table called wallet_trans_master, performs some calculations, and generates a report containing information such as the maximum transaction value, the address with the most transactions, and the date with the most transactions.
